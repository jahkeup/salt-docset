# Get the official Salt Dash docset

[Use Dash's docsets](https://kapeli.com/dash#docsets), they are kept
up to date by Kapeli.

I used this repo to produce docsets for myself back when Salt was not
distributed in docsets. I suppose that you could still find use in
generating the development docsets if you so desired but I believe
there are better methods for doing so now.

# Unofficial Salt Dash docset

This repo can be to produce a Salt.docset that can be used for Dash or
Zeal.

## Quick, give me the docset!

Okay! [Download me here!](https://github.com/jahkeup/salt-docset/releases)

Make sure you move it out of your downloads into a more permanent
location when you add it to Dash.

## Usage

Here's some easy steps to create your own docset, though you can
download one from the releases. If it gets out of sync with
[Salt's](https://github.com/saltstack/salt) current release and you
want to update that, please do and submit a PR. I'll happily accept
and update it for everyone.

1. `git clone` me. (or fork and clone your repo if you're messing with things)

2. Install some dependencies.

    You can use `make deps` to get
    everything you need but it does assume you're on OS X with homebrew
    installed *and* that you've got virtualenv running. If you don't no
    worries, just install `imagemagick`, `sphinx` or `python-sphinx` on
    some OSes, and my modified version of `doc2dash` (you can install
    via pip - `pip install git+https://github.com/jahkeup/doc2dash.git@master`).
   
3. Get (haha git) the git submodule aka Salt's source. (`git submodule
   update --init`).
   
4. Create the docset - `make docset`

5. (optional) Add docset to dash - `make add-docset` (Again, assumes
   OS X, don't run if you're not on OS X).


## Notes:

Item `3` on the list pulls whatever the last version of salt that I
pulled into the repo and commited in (`2014.1.4 - 4ab9e67`). You can
[take a look at the releases](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/releases)
and update that submodule to build docsets for whatever version your
heart desires. If you do update it to the current version and I have
not, please feel free to fork and create a pull request so I can
update both the submodule ref and upload a [docset release](https://github.com/jahkeup/salt-docset/releases) to Github.
